# Chicken Tinder üçó
Welcome to the repository for Chicken Tinder! This is an innovative application built for those who find it tough to decide where to have their next meal. Chicken Tinder allows two people to sync their accounts, accept or reject restaurants within the desired area, and when they both match on a place, that's where they dine!

## Project Description üêî
We all know the struggle of endlessly debating where to eat with our friends, significant others, or colleagues. Chicken Tinder is here to save you from that. The application functions by one user sending a sync request to another user, including an address, a radius distance, and the other user's email. Once the request is accepted, both users are shown a list of restaurants within the specified distance from the given address.

Each restaurant is shown one by one, and the users can either accept or reject. As soon as both users accept the same restaurant, the app will let you know that you've got a match, display a link to the restaurant on Google, and that's where you'll have your meal.

No more long-winded discussions, no more settling for less, find your perfect restaurant match with Chicken Tinder.
